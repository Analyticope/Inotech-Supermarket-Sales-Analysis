### Results/Findings
1 . Sales Performance Over Time
   
â€¢ Sales revenue peaked around August and gradually declined through February, dropping from over 10 million to under 8.5 million monthly.
â€¢ Despite the monthly decline, overall year-over-year revenue increased by nearly 77%.
â€¢ However, key metrics like quantity sold, average selling price, and customer count all declined sharply.

**Finding**: The business generated more revenue from fewer sales and fewer customers,indicating either a change in sales strategy (e.g., bulk or high-value purchases) or potential data gaps.

2 . Top-Performing Products
   
â€¢ Products such as Always Pads (â‚¦3.6M), Chi Exotic (â‚¦3.4M), and Bobo Juice (â‚¦2.8M) were the highest revenue generators.
â€¢ Most top products are fast-moving consumer goods, especially beverages and household items.

**Finding**: These products are key revenue drivers and likely have strong, consistent demand. They should be prioritized in stock planning and promotions.

3 . City-wise Revenue Distribution
   
â€¢ The highest revenue came from Lagos and Benin City (â‚¦8M each), followed by Uyo, Calabar, Enugu, and Ilorin, all generating over â‚¦7M.

**Finding**: Sales are fairly balanced across multiple cities, indicating good regional reach and performance.

4 . Customer Revenue Contribution
   
â€¢ A small group of customers, like Alison Ryan (â‚¦114K) and Alicia Neal (â‚¦106K), contributed significantly to total sales.

**Finding**: The business heavily depends on a few high-value customers, which presents both opportunity and risk. Retaining these customers is critical.

  ### Recommendation
1 . Address the Sales Decline Over Time
    Look into why sales have been dropping month by month,it could be due to seasonality, stock issues, or lack of promotions. Try running targeted marketing campaigns 
    during slower months to boost sales.

2 . Keep Best-Selling Products in Focus
   Always Pads, Chi Exotic, and Bobo Juice are strong performers. Make sure these are always in stock and consider bundling them with other products to drive more sales.
   
3 .Learn From Top-Performing Cities
   Lagos and Benin City are leading in revenue. Study whatâ€™s working in those cities and try to apply the same strategies (ads, pricing, promotions) in lower-performing 
   areas.
   
4 .Prioritize High-Value Customers
  A few customers are spending a lot â€” theyâ€™re clearly valuable. Show appreciation with loyalty rewards, personalized offers, or exclusive discounts to keep them coming 
  back.
  
5 .Support All Payment Methods
   Customers are using a variety of payment options almost equally. Keep offering this flexibility, but you might consider encouraging digital payments with small 
   incentives like cashback or discounts.
   
6 .Investigate Drops in Quantity, Price, and Customer Count
  Even though revenue is up, fewer people are buying, and fewer items are being sold. Check if this is due to a reporting issue or if the business is shifting to fewer, 
   larger sales â€” and adjust your strategy accordingly.
